    "The data files are stored in the same github directory as this notebook.  For the purposes of this exercise, we won't go into too many details of the datasets.  They were all generated from the same messy data set, but after EDA and feature engineering in R, choice and defintion of new features evolved. However many tidy data files were generated as saved during the learning process.  They have many features in common, but have important differences.\n",
